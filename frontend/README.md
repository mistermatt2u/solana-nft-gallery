## MisterMatt2U's NFT Gallery
This dApp serves as a basic NFT gallery. It will display all NFTs associated with a given Solana wallet. The dApp provides the following features:
- Display NFTs associated with a Solana wallet
- Apply a category to an NFT
- Mark NFTs as a favorite

### *Frontend Framework*
This project uses the Solana Scaffold (https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold) as the framework. Minimal changes were added in order to support the functionality of the nft-gallery program. The wallet integration, UI theme/appearance, etc. is per default; and was not changed.
